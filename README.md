## 🚀 Deployment

### Railway Deployment

This app is configured for deployment on Railway with automatic deployments:

1. **Development Environment**: Deploys from `develop` branch
2. **Production Environment**: Deploys from `main` branch

For detailed deployment setup, see [CICD_SETUP.md](./CICD_SETUP.md)

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and start
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DB_STRING` | MongoDB connection string | Required |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session secret key | Required |
| `PORT` | Port number | 3000 |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | development |

### Database Setup

1. Install MongoDB locally or use MongoDB Atlas
2. Create a database named `todoapp`
3. Update the `DB_STRING` in your `.env` file

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `npm test`
5. Run linting: `npm run lint`
6. Commit changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
7. Push to branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. Open a Pull Request

### Development Workflow

- All changes should be made in feature branches
- Pull requests require passing CI checks
- Code must pass linting and security scans
- Tests must pass with adequate coverage

## 📝 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `GET /` - Home page
- `GET /login` - Login page
- `POST /login` - Authenticate user
- `GET /signup` - Registration page
- `POST /signup` - Register new user
- `GET /logout` - Logout user

### Todos
- `GET /todos` - Get all todos for authenticated user
- `POST /todos` - Create a new todo
- `PUT /todos/markComplete` - Mark todo as complete
- `PUT /todos/markIncomplete` - Mark todo as incomplete
- `DELETE /todos` - Delete a todo

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**
   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check DB_STRING in .env file

2. **Session Issues**
   - Ensure SESSION_SECRET is set
   - Clear browser cookies

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change PORT in .env file
   - Kill process using the port: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill`
